Hello Team,

Following our investigation, we identified that several crypto_LUKS volumes failed to mount because the underlying RAID0 array (md1) experienced a temporary disk disconnection.
iDRAC reports clearly show:

“Drive 4 is removed from disk drive bay 1”
“Drive 4 is installed in disk drive bay 1”

This brief SAS link loss caused multiple Buffer I/O errors on dm-36 and other dm-crypt devices. As a result, several encrypted volumes became inactive and could not be recovered online.

Because the entire storage stack (RAID0 → dm-crypt → filesystem) is impacted, a server reboot is required to reload all device-mapper tables, reinitialize dm-crypt, and restore the mount points cleanly.

Please proceed with a reboot during the next available maintenance window.

Thanks for your support.

Regards,
